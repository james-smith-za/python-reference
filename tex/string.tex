\chapter{Strings and numbers}

There is lots of occasion to work with strings!

\section{Stripping non-numeric characters from a string}

If you're importing strings from a text file, but someone has mixed other things which aren't numbers in with the strings.
\lstinputlisting{src/non-numeric-strip.py} %chktex 11
This uses Python's list filtering. This is a very simple thing which doesn't require importing any additional modules such as \code{re}. This will only work for positive integers (TODO: verify this). If you've got negative numbers and points / commas, these are not digits, so won't get in.%chktex 13
